This Website was made to store all of my notes for Code 201.

## About Me

Hello, my name is Caleb I am a student currently learning HTML and CSS. I like gaming and anime and music.

### Reading Assignments

### HTML CSS & JavaScript

While reading the HTML and CSS book I found some new commands that I didn't know about such as the _hr_ Command that puts a line inbetween your sentances and _del_ that will cross out any line of unwanted text. CSS Does all the styling with the _style_ command that allows you to change the style of text and the background color. JavaScript has alot of things to it. First thing I'm taking note of is _variables_, _variables_ are used to store stuff in things such as numbers or text. You can then use these variables in your commands like _arrays_ which store's a list of variables. There are also _If_ statements that evaluate or checks a condition It can also be paired with and _else_ statement that checks the condition and if it resolves it true it will execute the command.


### HTML Lists, Control Flow with JS, and the CSS Box Model.

While I read through this I noted many things like the lists in HTML you can do Unordered lists and ordered list. But we already know all of that, what I learnmed from this was that there were definiton list and nested list.
