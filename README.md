This Website was made to store all of my notes for Code 201.

## About Me

Hello, my name is Caleb I am a student currently learning HTML and CSS. I like gaming and anime and music.

### Reading Assignments

### HTML CSS & JavaScript

While reading the HTML and CSS book I found some new commands that I didn't know about such as the _hr_ Command that puts a line inbetween your sentances and _del_ that will cross out any line of unwanted text. CSS Does all the styling with the _style_ command that allows you to change the style of text and the background color. JavaScript has alot of things to it. First thing I'm taking note of is _variables_, _variables_ are used to store stuff in things such as numbers or text. You can then use these variables in your commands like _arrays_ which store's a list of variables. There are also _If_ statements that evaluate or checks a condition It can also be paired with and _else_ statement that checks the condition and if it resolves it true it will execute the command.


### HTML Lists, Control Flow with JS, and the CSS Box Model.

While I read through this I noted many things like the lists in HTML you can do Unordered lists and ordered list. But we already know all of that, what I learnmed from this was that there were definiton list and nested list. You can also add boxes for your text in CSS you can add different colors to them and change overall the whole website layout. JS talks about arrays and arrays are used for storing things like variables or text you can output these arrays in different ways. This also talks about While loops and For loops While loops are used to keep a loop going endlessly until you forcibly end it while for loops on the other had go for however long you tell it to.


### HTML Links, JS Functions, and Intro to CSS Layout

In HTML you can add links to things like emails and other sites or you can link to other pages on that specific site. CSS you can drastically adjust the website you can do pretty crazy designs you can adjust page sizes, use fixed width layouts, and use liquid layouts all these layouts have their own design so I will be sure to expirement with them. JS teaches us about functio. Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a specific task. The article given today talked about pair programming. It focused on the pros of pair programming, that being Increased efficiency, social skills, and more.


### Images, Color, Text

You can add images to your code using the _img_ command you can do many more things with images like resizing and changing the placement of them. You can also add colors with CSS you can add colors to everything including backgrounds and text. You can chagne the font of your text in CSS and the size as well as being able to underline specific words.


### Problem Domain, Objects, and the DOM

Objects group together a set variable and functions to create a model of something you would recognize in the real world. in an object, variables and functions take on new names
The document object model (or DOM for short) is used to medel an HTML page.


### Object-Oriented Programming, HTML Tables

A table represents information in a grid format. you can structure a table with stuff like the _Table_ command and the _tr_ command. Theres also different types of tables like Long tables and normal tables. In this chapter we talked about objects and objects are used to store information like someones age for example. You can use objects for a lot of things like storing them in arrays and displaying info.
